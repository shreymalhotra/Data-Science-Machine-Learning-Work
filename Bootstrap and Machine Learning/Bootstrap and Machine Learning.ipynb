    "In this homework, we will examine the bootstrap in greater detail. One focus is to solidify the two basic concepts behind the bootstrap:\n",

    "1. Use the sample as the bootstrap population. We can find the sampling distribution of the statistic of interest, when the sampling from the bootstrap population.\n",
    "1. Use the Monte Carlo method to approximate the sampling distribution of the bootstrap statistic.  That is, draw thousands of samples from the bootstrap population, calculate the\n",
    "statistic for each bootstrap sample, and use the distribution of these bootstrap statistics to approximate the actual sampling distribution of the bootstrap statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second focus of this homework is on variants on the standard bootstrap that improve the bootstrap in cases where the sample is highly skewed or when the data are not from a simple random sample. \n",
    " \n",
    "This homework has the following tasks: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Develop a functional approach to bootstrapping any statistic for any sample\n",
    "* Derive the exact bootstrap distribution of a statistic for a small sample\n",
    "* Compare confidence intervals based on the *t*-distribution to those where the sample SD is replaced with bootstrapped SD. \n",
    "* Investigate the studentized bootstrap method, which is used when the sample has a skewed distribution \n",
    "* Explore how to bootstrap data that have been collected via a random sampling scheme other than the simple random sample."
