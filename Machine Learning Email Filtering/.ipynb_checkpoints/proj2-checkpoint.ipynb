    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. You will create a classifier using the training dataset.\n",

    "3. You will upload your predictions as a CSV to https://www.kaggle.com/t/433a6bca95f94a78a0d2a6e7e8b311c3\n",

    "0. **Your notebook to OkPy**. You can do this by running the `ok.submit()` cell at the bottom of this notebook. Note that there is no autograder for this assignment so you will not receive autograder emails.\n",
    "0. **Your notebook's written answers to GradeScope.** The cell to export the notebook is located at the bottom of this notebook. If you have trouble converting your notebook to PDF, you may upload your notebook to http://datahub.berkeley.edu/ and run the cell there.\n",
    "0. **Your model's predictions on the test set to Kaggle**, a website that hosts machine learning competitions. Kaggle will output your your accuracy on the test set so that you will know whether you've met the accuracy threshold or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To prevent you from fitting to the test set, you may only upload predictions to Kaggle twice per day.** This means you should start early. In addition, if you decide to pair with someone else, your group only gets two submissions per day (not four).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project (notebook + Gradescope submissions) is officially due Friday, Dec 1 at 11:59:59pm since we can't make assignments due after classes end. However, we will accept submissions until **Monday, Dec 4 at 11:59:59pm** without using slip days. Submissions after Dec 4 will use 1 slip day each day after Dec 4. The Kaggle competition will remain open until **Saturday Dec 9 at 11:59:59pm**.\n",

As such, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models and their regularized forms**.  This means no random forest, CART, neural nets, etc.  However, you are free to feature engineer to your heart's content.  Remember that domain knowledge is the third component of data science."

    "With this in mind, it is now your assignment to make your classifier more accurate. In particular, in order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the test set. To see your accuracy on the test set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `test` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",

    "    1. Number of words in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!' were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number / percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether or not the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email. \n",
    "    1. Using bag-of-words or [td-idf](http://www.tfidf.com/).\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. (To help you out, we've given you a set of [English stopwords](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stop_words) in `stopwords.csv`)\n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g., the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use whatever method you prefer in order to create features. However, we want to make it fair to students who are seeing these techniques for the first time.  As such, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models and their regularized forms**. This means no random forest, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not give you a code skeleton to do this, so feel free to create as many cells as you need in order to tackle this task. However, you should show us your process as outlined here:"

    "It turns out that there's a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. In most cases we won't be able to get perfect sensitivity and specificity, so we have to select which of two we value more. For example, in the case of cancer screenings we value specificity more because false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it >=0.5 probability of being spam. However, we can adjust that cutoff: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it >=0.7 probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC (receiver operating charactistic) curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. We will discuss this during lecture, and you can also read [this blog post for more information.](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/what-is-an-roc-curve/).\n",
